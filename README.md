 # Elevator System Backend Challenge

## Problem Statement

In this challenge, you are asked to implement the business logic for a simplified elevator model in Python. We'll ignore a lot of what goes into a real-world elevator, like physics, maintenance overrides, and optimizations for traffic patterns. All you are asked to do is to decide whether the elevator should go up, go down, or stop.

### Table of Contents:

- Each elevator has below capabilities
- Elevator System takes care of
- Assumptions
- Asks
- API’s required
- Submission Process and Judging Criteria

### A. Each elevator has below capabilities:

- Move Up and Down
- Open and Close Door
- Start and Stop Running
- Display Current Status
- Decide whether to move up or down, based on a list of requests from users.

### B. Elevator System takes care of:

- Initializing N elevators
- Maintaining elevator states
- Handling requests from users and deciding elevator movements
- Coordinating actions of multiple elevators if there are more than one

### C. Assumptions:

- The elevator system does not consider complex factors like physics, maintenance overrides, or traffic patterns.
- Only basic functionalities as mentioned above are implemented.

### D. Asks:

Implement the business logic for a simplified elevator model in Python using Django.

### E. API’s required:

1. API to receive user requests for elevator movement.
2. API to query the current status of elevators.

### F. Submission Process and Judging Criteria:

- Submission should include the Python code implemented using Django, including Models, ViewSets, Serializers, etc.
- Judging criteria may include the correctness of the implemented functionalities, code quality, adherence to Django best practices, and efficiency of the elevator system.
